      - [VByteseq s] is used for values of  [sequence<byte>] Ice type.
      - [VEnum k]: The number [k] is the position in the declaration.
      - [VClass cls_ref]: We use a reference as argument to simply the
        unmarshalling algorithm. User code should never see [`Placeholder]

     keyword was introduced. There is probably a semantic difference, because
     the ICE runtime does not treat both modes as equal, but:
     - An ICE server accepts `Nonmutating client invocations where `Idempotent
       is declared in the slice def
     - The reverse is not true: an operation declared as `Nonmutating in the
       server slice file must be invoked as `Nonmutating.

     Hydro does not have a backwards-compatibility problem (no old clients

      - [`Connect_error e]: An error happened while connecting to the
        server, or while doing the initial handshake. The exception [e]
        explains the error. It is ensured that the server has never seen
        the RPC call. (This is a fatal error, and the client is shut down.)
      - [`Client_is_down]: A call is tried with a client that is already
        shut down
      - [`User_exception sv]: The remote function raises a user-level
        exception, i.e. an exception that is declared in the Ice IDL.
        The sliced value [sv] represents the exception.
      - [`Object_does_not_exist(id,facet,op)]: Cannot call the function
        [op], optionally in [facet], of the remote object [id] because
        the object is unknown to the server.
      - [`Facet_does_not_exist(id,facet,op)]: Cannot call the function
        [op], optionally in [facet], of the remote object [id] because
        the facet is unknown to the server.
      - [`Operation_does_not_exist(id,facet,op)]: Cannot call the function
        [op], optionally in [facet], of the remote object [id] because
        the function is unknown to the server.
      - [`Unknown_local_exception s]: While performing the remote operation
        the server caught an exception that is declared in the IDL
        as local exception (such exception cannot be marshalled at all).
        The string [s] explains the exception.
      - [`Unknown_user_exception s]: While performing the remote operation
        the server caught an exception that is declared in the IDL
        but not for the operation. The string [s] explains the exception.
      - [`Unknown_exception s]: While performing the remote operation
        the server caught an unknown exception. 
        The string [s] explains the exception.
      - [`Error e]: An error happened that is not one of the above.
        The exception [e] explains the error. 
        (This is a fatal error, and the client is shut down.)
