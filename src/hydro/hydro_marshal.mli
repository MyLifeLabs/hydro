val encapsulate : (Netbuffer.t -> int -> unit) -> Netbuffer.t -> int -> unit
  (** [encapsulate f b e]: Calls [f b] and prepends the encapsulation
     header. [e] is the minor encoding version. (The major encoding version
     is always 1.)
   *)

val marshal : system -> htype -> bool -> value -> Netbuffer.t -> int -> unit
  (** [marshal sys ht class_flag val nb e]: Encodes the value [val] which is
     supposed to be of type [ht] and appends the string to [nb].
     The [class_flag] must be true if [ht] contains classes.
     Logically, an encapsulation is created, but the encapsulation
     header is not written. [e] is the minor encoding version.
     (The major encoding version is always 1.)
   *)

val marshal_exn : system -> hexn -> sliced_value -> Netbuffer.t -> int -> unit
  (** [marshal_exn sys hx val nb e]: Encodes the exception value [val] which is
     supposed to be of (static) exn type [hx] and appends the string to [nb].
     Logically, an encapsulation is created, but the encapsulation
     header is not written. [e] is the minor encoding version.
     (The major encoding version is always 1.)
   *)

val marshal_msg : system -> compression_status -> msg -> int -> int ->
       msg_buffer
  (** [marshal_msg sys zstat msg p e]:
     Returns a message buffer (header and bodies) for a message.
     [p] is the minor protocol version. [e] is the minor encoding version
     (which must have been used for all encapsulations). (The major version
     for protocol and encoding is always 1.)
