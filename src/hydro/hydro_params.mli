        number of seconds until when a response must have been arrived.
        Otherwise the call times out with a
        [Client_condition `Message_timeout]. If [None], there is no
        such timeout condition. (Only used for twoway calls.)
      - [destination]: For unconnected UDP sockets, this parameter must
        be passed to set the destination of the call. For connected
        sockets this parameter must not be passed.
      - [context]: If set to [ctx], the key/value pairs in [ctx] are to
        be passed as context. If not set a reasonable default is passed.

     - [trans_timeout]: If non-negative, a timeout on the transport
       level is set. This means that connections that block for more
       than this number of seconds time out. In this case, the whole
       client fails, and all pending calls see a
       [Client_condition `Transport_timeout] if it happens in the middle
       of a connection, or [Client_condition `Connect_timeout] if it
       happens in the connect phase. (Default: -1)
     - [msg_timeout]:  If non-negative, the number [tmo] is the maximum
       number of seconds until when a response must have been arrived.
       Otherwise the call times out with a
       [Client_condition `Message_timeout]. This error is non-fatal,
       and only the single call times out. (Only used for twoway calls.)
       (Default: -1)
     - [idle_timeout]: when the client has been idle for this number of
       seconds, it is automatically shut down. "Idle" means that there is
       neither something to send nor a message is expected to be received.
       (Default: -1)
     - The [exception_handler] is invoked for exceptions that cannot be handled
       by the client. The handler is never invoked for [Unbound_exception]s -
       these always fall through to the caller. In any case the client is shut
       down for exceptions that cannot be handled by the client.
       (Default: default_exception_handler)
     - [max_proto_minor] and [max_enc_minor] are the maximum minor versions
       of the server. These values are only used in the datagram case; for
       stream connections they can be obtained directly from the server.
       If not set, minor numbers of 0 are assumed.
